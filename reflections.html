                        <p>In this course, we were assigned to read articles about the topics discussed in class. These are my reflections on the articles about diversity in team, the pay gap between men and women, and keeping women employed in technical fields.</p>

                        <h3>October 31, 2016</h3>
                        <p>Diversity of a group plays a large role in the success of that group. This includes not only diversity of thought, but diversity of person. Researchers Hewlett, Marshall, and Sherbin describe these two kinds of diversity as acquired diversity and inherent diversity, respectively. In their research, they found that companies whose leaders have at least three acquired and three inherent diversity traits innovate faster than their competition. This is because minorities form a large enough portion of the company that leaders are more accepting towards unconventional ideas. They also found that in companies lacking diverse traits in their leaders, conventional minority groups, such as women, people of color, and LGBTs have less likelihood of their ideas being accepted by leadership. In part, this is due to understanding the client better: “A team with a member who shares a client’s ethnicity is 152% likelier than another team to understand that client” (<a href="https://hbr.org/2013/12/how-diversity-can-drive-innovation" target="_blank">How Diversity Can Drive Innovation</a>). Inherently diverse leaders in a diverse environment are more likely to give team members their turn to speak up.</p>
                        <p>The Harvard Business Review also covered research done by Professors Woolley and Malone that suggested that team intelligence was highly correlated with the number of women on the team. In an interview with HBR, the professors explained that the team intelligence had a stronger correlation with social sensitivity, which is more present among females than males. The surprising finding was that other factors that seemed like they would determine team intelligence had very little correlation. These factors include group satisfaction, group cohesion, group motivation, and individual intelligence. The fact that “group intelligence had relatively little to do with individual intelligence” should come as no big surprise (<a href="https://hbr.org/2011/06/defend-your-research-what-makes-a-team-smarter-more-women" target="_blank">Defend Your Research: What Makes a Team Smarter? More Women</a>).</p>
                        <p>In my past experience, the overall success of a team seemed little to do with how much we wanted to work together or how knowledgeable we each were about the subject (although those certainly helped boost our morale). The most successful research group I have been in so far was one in which the team members knew how to present to our diverse audience and how to manage our time to the final product. Perhaps most importantly, the leader of our team was a female. Coincidence? I think not.</p>

                        <h3>November 9, 2016</h3>
                        <p>Closely related to the discussions in lectures this week, the articles of this week focused mainly on the disparity between the amount of effort and time women vs men had in the workplace and in the household. Melinda Gates makes a crucial point about what she calls “unpaid work” in the <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/2016-Annual-Letter" target="_blank">Bill and Melinda Gates 2016 Annual Letter</a>. Gender roles in household work have existed forever and still affect first-world countries regardless of the belief that we should have moved on. Women are societally expected to do chores in the house such as cooking, cleaning, and caring for other family members. She presents statistics that show the wide difference between the time women work in the home and the time men work in the home (a 6 to 1 ratio), and the disparity is pretty surprising. I had seldom thought of the household workload that my mother had to go through until this past summer, when she decided to “prepare me for the college life” and taught me how to cook and clean my bathroom. Before that, I occasionally had to wash the clothes, clean my room, and wash the dishes. I expected to continue “traditional roles” once I grew up, but after the surprising evidence presented in this open letter, I will definitely reconsider my fair share of unpaid work. This article has made me reconsider the places such implicit biases come from, such as family values, advertisements, and cultural/social norms.</p>
                        <p>In the articles in the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gretchen-kelly/the-thing-all-women-do-you-dont-know-about_b_8630416.html" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a> and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/opinion/sunday/sheryl-sandberg-and-adam-grant-on-women-doing-office-housework.html?emc=eta1&_r=0" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, Kelly, Grant, and Sandberg analyze the effect this implicit bias about gender stereotypes has on the behavior of women and the double standards they are held to in the office. Kelly warns of the tendency for women to unconsciously avoid confrontation and de-escalate situations. Because of the “unconscious” nature of this behavior, I probably have not noticed it in fellow co-workers or classmates due to some cultural biases that affect my expectations of social exchanges. Grant and Sandberg point out the public versus private nature of contributions usually associated with men and women respectively in the workplace. Although I cannot speak for every man, I have to say that positive contributions I do that are known to more people receives more congratulations that private, one-on-one work. The former is also somewhat more motivating at least for me. In the future, I will rethink the true impact my work, public or private, has on the work at hand.</p>

                        <p>November 16, 2016</p>
                        <p>This week’s articles cover many different factors and strategies of getting women interested, employed, and retained in technical fields. Emily Peck of the Huffington Post believes <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-workplace-gender-equality-fairygodboss_us_569e84b6e4b0cd99679b8a98" target="_blank">the obvious “secret”</a> to satisfied women in the workplace is to “promote and recruit women into leadership and management positions” so that women in the workplace perceive a greater equality in genders. The study referenced in the article also found a strong positive correlation between programs in the workplace that support a work-life balance and overall job satisfaction. Conversely, Clint Boulton recounts a female executive’s view of the biggest influencer of promotion: mere-exposure. (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect" target="_blank">mere-exposure effect</a>) <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/2997722/cio-role/women-cios-say-visibility-is-key-to-closing-gender-gap.html?phint=newt%3Dcio_insider&phint=idg_eid%3D56d2e955200034311c2f3e2fcce010b7#tk.CIONLE_nlt_insider_2015-11-02" target="_blank">According to her experience</a>, women are much less likely than men to approach their superiors and hence don’t form a strong boss-employee relationship with them. She also pointed out that women in leadership positions also needed to be transparent and “visible” about their journeys and advancements in the corporate world. Along with forming closer bonds within the company, forming bonds with current women in tech leadership and networking with other inspiring women in events such as the <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2016/women-leaders-tech-panel/?utm_source=GeekWire+Newsletters&utm_campaign=978d092c8c-daily-digest-email&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_4e93fc7dfd-978d092c8c-233320461&mc_cid=978d092c8c&mc_eid=13d64a693f" target="_blank">Connect 2016 Conference</a> can lead to greater success. A more radical approach to this kind of networking is Shelley Zalis’s traveling mingling space, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/fashion/girls-lounge-businesswomen.html?emc=eta1" target="_blank">Girls’ Lounge</a>. This is a organized free space at conferences and professional festivals where businesswomen mingle whilst embracing their femininity. Workplace-diversity-studying nonprofit Catalyst has a ultimately simpler message: be more inclusive to the “others,” people who may feel left out of contributions and decision making; <a href="http://www.catalyst.org/zing/stand-out-without-being-left-out" target="_blank">“stand out without being left out”</a>.</p>
                        <p>Based on the articles given and my limited experience in the workforce, I believe that good advice for anyone feeling out of place during work, not just women, should define themselves based on how they want to be perceived. Embracing one’s shared subculture such as in the Girls’ Lounge sounds wonderful as long as one also keeps in mind what one will get out of the experience and how one can use his or her interests as a distinguishing trait in the workplace. Keeping close connections with superiors in companies is vital indeed as that acts as a way of getting one’s foot in the door to higher positions.</p>
